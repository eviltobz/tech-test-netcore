## Task 1
The instructions for getting started didn't mention anything about setting up the DB, so it crashed when creating a new user. I ran the command "dotnet ef database update" from the \tech-test-netcore\Todo folder to set up the DB, and then was able to use the site.

*Note* By having candidates fork your repo, it's possible for us to see the repos that others have created before us. When forking there is a link to all other forks, which would make it easy to cheat.


## Task 4
The task didn't specify what the "friendly" text should be. Given that the code was using ResponsiblePartyId I worked on the assumption that "Responsible Party" would be an understood term, like the whole concept of the ubiquitous language in DDD, but I did also consider putting something a little less formal like "Task Owner" as well. In a real world scenario I might have developed a better feel for the product & audience to know what to use, or if not would check with a product owner or similar if wording was important.
