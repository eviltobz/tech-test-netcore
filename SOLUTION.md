# Task 1
The instructions for getting started didn't mention anything about setting up the DB, so it crashed when creating a new user. I ran the command "dotnet ef database update" from the \tech-test-netcore\Todo folder to set up the DB, and then was able to use the site.

*Note* By having candidates fork your repo, it's possible for us to see the repos that others have created before us. When forking there is a link to all other forks, which would make it easy to cheat.
